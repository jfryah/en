People became preoccupied with their livelihood, and their hearts toward the Lord gradually turned cold.

The saints, led by the two co-workers, urged Witness Lee to come and help the church in Manila

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
After the war, the two co-workers, Brothers Meek and Wu, appointed nine elders (including themselves plus Brother Ting) and 24 deacons and deaconesses to serve. The post-war situation left people preoccupied with their livelihoods, causing them to gradually lose their love for the Lord. The spiritual condition of the saints grew bleak, and the supply of the word became stale. It was not uncommon for the chaplain of American soldiers to be asked to fill in and give the message on Lord’s Day. During this time, a popular catchphrase among the saints was “opening canned goods,” meaning that the speaking was no longer fresh, that they were old stock. As a result, meeting attendance steadily declined. In this stale backdrop, the co-workers, elders, and deacons/deaconesses once again sought help from Brother Witness Lee.

戰後由繆、吳二位同工設立了九位長老，廿四位男女執事。但光復之後，人為著謀生而勞碌，對主失去愛心。屬靈情形逐漸冷淡，話語的供應也越覺陳舊。主日講台常請美國的隨軍牧師來填缺。那時在我們中間就有一句流行語，「開罐頭」，意思是東西不新鮮，舊貨。結果聚會人數就越過越少。在這退後的光景中，同工們、長老和男女執事再一次向李常受尋求幫助。
