title: 主恢復的流臨及中國

馬尼拉召會在這段時間對於主所恢復的一些真理尚缺少看見。目前為止還未直接從倪柝聲接受幫助，反而間接從他的書報中受到幫忙。李常受將馬尼拉召會的這段歷史稱為「不清不楚的開始」。

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At this time, the church in Manila had moved its meeting hall to Gandara Street and changed its name to Christian Assembly Hall, registering with the government as the Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel. 

It was apparent that the saints lacked clarity about some of the truths the Lord was recovering at the time. Until then, they had not yet received direct help from Watchman Nee, only indirect help through his publications. Witness Lee would later describe this historical period of the church in Manila as “an unclear beginning.”

此時馬尼拉召會已經把會所遷移到 Gandara 街，且改名為「基督徒福音堂」，又以 「Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel」之名向政府註冊。

馬尼拉召會在這段時間對於主所恢復的一些真理尚缺少看見。目前為止還未直接 從倪柝聲接受幫助，反而間接從他的書報中受到幫忙。李常受將馬尼拉召會的這段 歷史稱為「不清不楚的開始」。
