<!--- TRANSCRIPT
When Brother Lee arrived in Manila in 1950, he found the condition of the church to be less than ideal. The church life was stagnant, with little fruit-bearing, and the organic function of the saints was not evident in the services. Recognizing the need for change, all three groups of serving ones — the elders, the co-workers, and the deacons and deaconesses — humbly confessed their shortcomings and willingly handed over the leadership of the church entirely to Brother Lee. They earnestly requested him to take charge of the church, the work, and all the services. Brother Lee acceded to their request.

李弟兄於1950來到馬尼拉，覺得召會的光景不太理想。召會生活停滯下來，服事上也看不到聖徒們生機的功用。三班服事者，既長老，同工和男女執事意識到需要改變。他們謙卑承認自己的過失，全體願意「交出來」，讓李弟兄重新安排。他們迫切要求李弟兄管理召會，工作和所有的事奉。李弟兄也同意了。
