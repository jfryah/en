Brother Lee testified that during those eleven years from 1950 to 1961, he did not do the work of an organization; rather, bit by bit he was doing an organic work.  Thus, the organic function of the living organism, the Body of Christ, manifested itself with spontaneous growth and fruit-bearing.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In November 1984, fifteen years after the turmoil of 1961, when Brother Lee returned to the Philippines and held a conference in Quezon City, he spoke about the history of the turmoil in Manila. Seeing the church’s condition then, Brother Lee expressed encouragement, saying, “Today I am very happy and at ease because I can see that the work of sowing, planting, and watering during those eleven years have yielded fruit. At that time some of the brothers were still small “tree seedlings” — only sprouts with hardly any growth. Today those brothers have become elders... Thank and praise the Lord. This work is not of man but of God; it is God who causes such ones to grow.”   

Brother Lee testified that during those eleven years from 1950 to 1961, he did not do the work of an organization; rather, bit by bit he was doing an organic work. Thus, the organic function of the living organism, the Body of Christ, manifested itself with spontaneous growth and fruit-bearing. 

李弟兄於1984年，即1961年風波發生十五年之後回到菲律濱在計順市舉行特會。當時他講到馬尼拉風波的歷史。李弟兄看到如今召會的光景大受鼓勵。他說:「今天我很喜樂舒暢，因為我十一年間在這裏所作撒種、栽種和澆灌的工作，終於 有果效了。那時候一些弟兄姊妹只是小樹苗，幾乎沒有任何成長。今天這些弟兄們都成了長老。感謝讚美主。這不是人的工作，乃是神作的;是神使人成長。」

李弟兄作了見證，從1950至1961十一年期間，他沒有作任何組織的工作，反而他一點一點作生機的工作。因此，基督的身體，這生機體的生機功用自己顯現出自然 的成長和結果。
