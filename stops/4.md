<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the early 1920s, the Lord gained a group of young, fervent Chinese brothers in the southern city of Foochow, among whom were Leland Wang, Watchman Nee, and Faithful Luke. They received help and mentorship from Margaret E. Barber, a British missionary with informal ties to the Plymouth Brethren. These young men, schoolmates from different cohorts at the Anglican Trinity College, grew up with a Western-style education. After graduation, they ardently consecrated their lives to preaching the gospel instead of pursuing more lucrative careers.

主於1920初期在南方福州市得著一班年輕熱心的中國弟兄們，其中包括王載、倪柝聲 和陸忠信。他們一同在和受恩教士那裏受幫助和指導。和教士是一位英國西教士，與普利 務斯弟兄會間接有關連。這班來自英國聖三一大學的同期青年人都在西方的教育方式成長。 大學畢業後他們不追求可以賺大錢的事業，反而奉獻他們的一生來傳福音。
