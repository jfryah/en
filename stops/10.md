<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Once he got off from the ship, Brother Nee was ushered to the home of Brother Huang Ho Seng and his younger sister, Ng Chu Ai. Remarkably, the house where Watchman Nee stayed is located on the very ground you stand on today, now the site of Meeting Hall #2 of the church in Manila! Years earlier, Brother Sammy Chan, the only grandson of Ng Chu Ai and grandnephew of Huang Ho Seng, generously offered this property to the church at a below-market rate before emigrating to the United States to pursue a career in medicine.

既下了船，他被接到黃和聲弟兄和他妹妹黃慈愛姊妹家招待居住。倪柝聲當初所住的家正是今天你們所站著的地方，也就是馬尼拉召會二會所!黃慈愛姊妹的唯一孫子和黃和聲弟兄的孫侄子 Sammy Chan 弟兄多年前在移居美國追求醫學時以低於市價把這棟房子供給了召會。
