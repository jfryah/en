<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Yet, as God was working, the enemy was also fiercely active. During the appointment of the elders, the two senior co-workers, Brothers Meek and Wu, who had previously served as elders, were not reappointed. 

Eventually, they became dissenting ones and led opposition against Brother Lee. In 1961, turmoil erupted in the church in Manila, leading to days of chaos. The dissenting ones wrote on a long bench in the meeting hall: “Down with the four elders; cast out Witness Lee.” 

One morning in August 1961, an elder who usually attended morning watch at the meeting hall found four security personnel standing guard, with a notice posted on the door declaring that no one without the express permission of the Board of Trustees could enter. The meeting hall had been taken over. The four new elders urgently sent a telegram to Brother Lee in Taiwan to inform him of the situation. At that moment, Brother Lee pondered, “Will there be any result of my sowing, planting, and watering there for the past eleven years?” During the period from 1950 to 1960, he had spent one-third of his time in Manila and two-thirds in Taipei.

當神在作工時，仇敵也是極其活躍的。兩位前長老，即繆和吳弟兄不再被設立為長老。

最後他們成為異議者，開始反對李弟兄。馬尼拉召會於 1961 年發生了風波。持異 議者在會所長椅上寫下:「打倒四位長老，趕出李常受。」

1961 年八月的一個上午，一位常常到會所晨更的弟兄發現有四位警衛站在門口，門上張貼著任何人沒有董事會的允許不可進入。會所被佔去了。四位新長老立刻致電在臺灣的李弟兄，向他報告這邊的情形。當時李弟兄心想:「我已過十一年在這裏的撒種、栽種、澆灌，到底有沒有果效?」他從1950至1960年期間，三分之一的時間在馬尼拉，三分之二則在臺北。
