<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the first half of 1922, having seen the light about the error of denominations, Watchman Nee, Leland Wang, and his wife took the bold step of breaking bread in Wang’s home instead of going to the denomination to receive communion. Watchman Nee later testified that he would never forget, even in eternity, the profound closeness to the heavens he felt that night. Thus was born the church in Foochow, Fujian province, standing firm outside the division of the denominations.  

倪柝聲、王載和他的妻子於一九二二年前半年看見了公會的錯誤，因此放膽開始 在王載家中擘餅，從此不接受公會的聖餐。倪柝聲後來見證說，他到永世都不能忘 記當晚的擘餅。他感受到天是離地何等的近。這是福建省福州召會在公會的分裂之外堅定站住的開始。
