<!--- TRANSCRIPT
For the time being, Brother Lee opted to retain all personnel and positions in order to seek guidance from the Lord before making any changes. However, he emphasized the importance of discontinuing the old practices and initiating new ones. He promptly established the deacon's office and appointed two sisters — Mercy Chen and Betty Ong – to serve and establish principles for all services. Given Brother Lee's commitments in Taiwan during this period, his time in Manila was limited. He planned to gradually rearrange the services of the elders and deacons, as well as the work of the co-workers. 

李弟兄當時答覆是:一切人位暫時照舊不動，等候到主面前尋求主的旨意，而後決定。不過他強調停止老舊的實行和開始新操練的重要性。他立刻設立執事室和指派兩位姊妹，陳美西和王淑貴來事奉和建立所有服事的原則。

這段日子李弟兄來回臺灣，所以他在馬尼拉的時間有限。他計劃漸漸重新安排長老，執事以及同工們的工作。
