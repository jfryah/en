<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At that time, Brother Lee was already in Taiwan. In 1949, when it became apparent that the Communists would prevail in China, Brother Nee insisted that Brother Lee emigrate to carry on their work in Taiwan and throughout the Far East; Brother Lee agreed. 

Meanwhile, in 1946, the Philippines had also become an independent country, and the Philippine government restricted the entry of Chinese citizens. Therefore, it was difficult for Chinese people to obtain a visa. 

It was not until the end of 1950 that the travel papers of Brother Lee were successfully processed, and a visa was obtained. Thus, on November 17, 1950, Witness Lee finally set foot on Philippine soil for the first time.

Initially, Brother Lee was given hospitality at the meeting hall in Soler Street. However, due to the presence of many mosquitoes and insects, on the third day of his visit, Brother Lee contracted a severe case of dysentery and was rushed to the emergency ward. By the Lord’s mercy, he recovered. 

李弟兄當時已經在臺灣。1949年當共軍將佔領全中國時，倪弟兄執意李弟兄移居到臺灣來實行工作，包括遠東，李弟兄也同意了。

菲律濱於1946年也成為獨立的國家。菲律濱政府限制中國人的入境，因此中國人很難拿到簽證。

李弟兄的入境手續直到1950年纔辦理妥當。因此李常受於1950年十一月十七日頭一次踏上菲律濱這個國家。

起初李弟兄被接待在Soler街的會所。然而，由於許多蒼蠅和蟲子，李弟兄在訪問的第三天感染痢疾，被送到急診室。主的憐憫讓他得以康復。
