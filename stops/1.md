   alt_text: Spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire

Christianity spread rapidly from the Mediterranean to Europe, largely through imperialism. Concurrently, degradation crept in and the truths in the Bible were almost entirely lost by the time of the Dark Ages.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Our story must begin with how the Lord’s recovery flowed to the virgin soil of China. 

Midway through the first millennium, the gospel had spread from the Mediterranean Sea to Europe largely through imperialism. However, with the intermixture of religion and politics, the church experienced degradation and decline, as described by the apostle Paul in his later epistles and by the apostle John in the book of Revelation. By the end of the sixth century, the truths in the Bible were almost entirely lost, plunging the world into what we now know as the Dark Ages. 

我們的故事必須從主的恢復如何流到中國這塊處女地開始。

福音在第一個千年世記中藉著帝國主義從地中海開展到歐洲。然而召會就如使徒保羅在他後期的書信以及使徒約翰在啟示錄中所描繪的受到宗教和政治的參雜而衰退墮落了。 聖經的真理在第六世記末期幾乎失去了，全然陷入世界裏。這段時間正是我們眾所公知的「黑暗時代」。
