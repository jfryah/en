<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In His wisdom, God directed the flow of the Lord’s recovery to the vast Gentile land of China, where He could begin His work anew on virgin soil. Here, free from the complexities and divisions that had marred the Western world, the Lord's recovery had a way to flow on and flourish.

神在祂的知慧中指引主的恢復流到中國這塊外邦之地。祂在這塊處女地開始新的工作。主的恢復遠離了破壞西方世界的種種分裂，且得著一條路來湧流直到興旺起來。
