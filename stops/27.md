<!--- TRANSCRIPT
While the enemy utilized man’s flesh to carry out damaging work, the Lord, in His sovereignty, performed a sanctifying work. During the turmoil, Brother K.H. Weigh (also known as Weigh Kwang-hsi), a co-worker trained under Watchman Nee who eventually served in Hong Kong, was greatly used by the Lord to supply and support the excommunicated elders in Manila. Recognizing his spiritual capacity, Brother Witness Lee personally requested Brother Weigh to go and provide help to the church in Manila during those turbulent days. 

當仇敵利用人的肉體來實行破壞的工作，主卻在祂的主宰之下作出分別的工作。風波期間主使用在倪柝聲之下受訓的一位同工，即魏光禧弟兄來供應和扶持被開除的長老們。他一直以來都在香港服事。李弟兄知道他屬靈的度量，所以親自請求他前來馬尼拉幫助這裏的聖徒度過這段風波的日子。
