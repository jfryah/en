<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Between 1951 and 1954, under Brother Lee's leadership, the eldership in the church underwent gradual changes. Initially, two of the previous elders, namely Chang Pan and Liu Ai San, were retained, but Chang later migrated to Brazil, and Liu resigned due to old age.

Four new elders were added during this period: Hwang Lien Seng and Gan Bong Kak in 1951, and Tan Giok San and Chang Ka Fu in 1954. As adjustments were made to all services, the church became very active in preaching the gospel, resulting in an increasing number of people being saved.

1951至1954年間，召會的長老職分在李弟兄的帶領之下有所改變。以前的長老只保留兩位，即張藩和柳靄山。只是張弟兄後來移民巴西，而柳也以年老造退。

這段日子加進四位新長老。1951年加了黃連勝、顏夢覺，而1954年加了陳玉山和 張家福。一切事奉重新調整，積極向外，推廣福音，帶人得救。
